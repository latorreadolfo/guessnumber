# guessnumber
guess number project

This project is just a javascript practice. The main objective is build a page wich has a random number picker from 0 to 10, and the user can guess typing a number.
If you fail the script should alert you that you guess number is bigger or lesser than the drawn number, once you guess the right number, you can start again.

That's all :) thank you for reading.
